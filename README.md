# Galway-Civic-Trust - Software Development Year 4
by Trevor Davies, Arjun Kharel and Patryk Piecha
##Overview
The objective of this project is to continue the development of cross platform Walking Tours app for the [Galway Civic Trust](http://galwaycivictrust.ie). Currently there is an app on Goole play store called [Galway City Waterway Walks] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.gcww893023&hl=en). This app was created by some of last years 4th year stundents.

For this project our task is to create an app for the remaining tours that the Galway Civic Trust has and give them the means to update, edit, delete and create new tours without the need of developers. We are planning to create an admin site for this purpose.
